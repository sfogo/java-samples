# Problems
- Count [North East Paths](problems/src/main/java/com/vnet/problems/NorthEastPaths.java) : in a grid, count the number of possible paths
from bottom left to top right knowing you can only go up or right. If the grid size is x by y, [see](docs/north-east-paths.md) why this is the same as C(x+y,x) or C(x+y,y).
