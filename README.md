# Problems
- Count [North East Paths](problems/src/main/java/com/vnet/problems/NorthEastPaths.java) : in a grid, count the number of possible paths
from bottom left to top right knowing you can only go up or right. If the grid size is x by y, [see](docs/north-east-paths.md) why this is the same as C(x+y,x) or C(x+y,y).
- List [North East Paths](problems/src/main/java/com/vnet/problems/NEPaths.java)
- North East Paths service deployed on [Heroku](http://app137.herokuapp.com/things/paths/?w=3&h=2) free tier
(_it may take a few seconds to wake up since Heroku free tier pauses unused services_.)
